## What does it do?

An app that allows users to automatically generate playlists based on the songs in the users' likes list on Spotify!

Authentication is done through Spotify User Authorization.

Once authenticated, the users' likes will be categorized into 5 different moods.

Users are able to save the mood playlists on the app, and edit it by deleting the playlist itself, or specific tracks.

Finally, the user may save the preferred playlist to Spotify App themselves, where they can edit the playlist name, description, etc.
